Hostel Management System -

Hostel admission, room allotment and managing monthly mess bills is a very cumbersome process using pen and paper. A computer system for the management of the hostel data is convenient and reliable. Having a common database management system for the entire hostel will help in reducing the manual processes such as records of which studentstays in which room, constantly keeping a track of which student has paid the bills, adding the leftover amount to the next month, etc.
